This meant when I converted the file into a csv file to upload the details, the csv wasn't reading the barcodes properly and changing them to 52862300000 etc.

To combat it:

Open as an excel sheet (or convert if you can't open as one)
highlight the (barcode/scientific notation) column
Go into Data / text to columns
Page 1: Check 'Delimited' / Next
Page 2: Check ' Tab' and change 'Text Qualifier' to " / Next
Page 3: Check 'Text' rather than 'general'
Finish
This should convert them all to display as the long number. You can then save it as a CSV file and the numbers won't be converted/formatted into scientific numbers.

Hope this helps!!
